**Project Title: Intern Prediction**

This project aims to predict placement attrition (whether a student gets placed or not) and lead conversion (whether a lead will convert into a customer) using machine learning algorithms. The project explores and analyzes three datasets:

1. **Placement Attrition Dataset**: Contains information about students' academic performance and whether they were placed in a job or not.
2. **Lead Conversion Dataset**: Includes data on customer interactions and whether a lead successfully converted into a sale (e.g., lead source, interaction history).
3. **Internship Dataset**: Focuses on predicting intern success based on skills, previous performance, and other relevant features.

### Key Features:
- **Supervised Learning**: Applied classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests for predicting placement attrition and lead conversion.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Included steps like handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, and performing feature selection.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix metrics.
- **Cross-Validation**: Used k-fold cross-validation to validate model performance and ensure reliability.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**

### Datasets Overview:
- **Placement Dataset**: Predicts if a student gets placed or not.
- **Attrition Dataset**: Predicts if the student has completed the course or not.
- **Lead Conversion Dataset**: Predicts if a lead will convert based on whether the lead course was taken or not.
