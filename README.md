Project Title: Intern Prediction - Placement Attrition & Lead Conversion
Course Taken: Data Science with Python (or specify the relevant course)
Issued by: TutorDude (or your course provider)

Description:
This project aims to predict placement attrition (whether a student gets placed or not) and lead conversion (whether a lead will convert into a customer) using machine learning algorithms. The project includes the exploration and analysis of three datasets:

Placement Attrition Dataset – Contains data about students' academic performance and whether they were placed or not.
Lead Conversion Dataset – Contains data on customer interactions and whether a lead converted into a sale (includes details like interaction history, lead source, etc.).
Internship Dataset – Focuses on predicting intern success based on skills, previous performance, and other features.
Key Features:

Supervised Learning: Applied classification models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests for both placement attrition and lead conversion.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, and feature selection.
Model Evaluation: Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix for model evaluation.
Cross-Validation: Applied k-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness in model performance.
Technologies Used:

Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Jupyter Notebooks
